Given an array, find maximum sum of smallest and second smallest elements chosen from all possible sub-arrays. More formally, if we write all (nC2) sub-arrays of array of size >=2 and find the sum of smallest and second smallest, then our answer will be maximum sum among them.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. The next line contains N space separated values of the array.

Output:
For each test case in  a new line print an integer denoting the maximum sum of smallest and second smallest elements chosen from all possible subarrays.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
2<=N<=100
1<=A[]<=100

Example:
Input:
2
3
4 5 1
5
4 3 1 5 6
Output:
9
11
